# JIT Compiler


## Toggling JIT on/off

It is possible to toggle the JIT compiler on/off during emulation. One
use case for this is to speed up your Workbench experience, but disable
the JIT before running games, for better compatibility.

> **Note:** Enabling JIT during emulation will not work unless FS-UAE was
> started with the JIT compiler initially on.
