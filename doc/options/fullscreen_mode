Default:
Example: window
Since: 1.1.8

You can set this option to window instead if you want to use
the fake fullscreen support (a borderless window the size of the current
display will be created instead of switching to real fullscreen).

Since version 2.3.10, the following values are supported:

* fullscreen - Classic fullscreen mode (SDL_FULLSCREEN)
* desktop - New fullscreen mode (SDL_FULLSCREEN_DESKTOP)
* window - Frameless window with same size as desktop

Since version 2.3.10, the default value varies by platform and whether
FS-UAE is compiled with SDL or SDL2.
