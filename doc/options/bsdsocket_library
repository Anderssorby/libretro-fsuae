Default: 0
Example: 1

Enable emulation of bsdsocket.library. This will allow Amiga OS to open
TCP connections (use web browsers, etc). The default is 0 (off).

To use with Windows hosts, you need FS-UAE version 2.1.20+.

Code:

    if c.bsdsocket_library.explicit:
        value = c.bsdsocket_library.explicit
    else:
        value = "0"
