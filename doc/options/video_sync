Alias: vsync, sync
Default: off
Description: Video synchronization
Example: auto
Type: choice

Video sync behaviour can be configured with the "video_sync" option. The
default setting is off. The available values are:

Value: auto ("Auto")
       If the host refresh rate matches the game's refresh rate, emulation
       and video will be synchronized to the display for perfectly smooth
       scrolling. If not, FS-UAE will only sync buffer swap to vblank in order
       to remove tearing.
Value: vblank ("Buffer swap only")
       Video buffer swap (but not emulation) will be synced to vblank
       to remove tearing. This value is used to prevent FS-UAE from
       synchronizing the emulation to the display.
Value: off ("Off")
       Video and emulation will not be synced to the display. Instead,
       a timer will be used to manage the emulation speed. You may see
       tearing on the display since buffer swaps are not synchronized to
       vblank either.

It is generally recommended to leave this option at auto. If you change
your desktop to a 50Hz screen mode, full synchronization and smooth
scrolling will be enabled automatically.

The previous value "full" is deprecated as of FS-UAE version 2.2.2, and it
will now behave as auto. See [assume_refresh_rate] if you need to force vsync.
