And of course for the RetroArch/Libretro team : "http://www.libretro.org/"

It's a quick hack.
At this time , works the basis but buggy on win/linux/android.

Remember ,Everything not working well, It's a debug release , so expect to more bug.

Default Control :

L2  Show/Hide statut
R2    
L   Show/Hide vkbd .
R   Change Mouse speed 1 to 6 . (for gui and emu)
SEL Toggle Mouse/Joy mode .
STR Toggle Num Joy . 
A   Fire/Mouse btn A / Valid key in vkbd
B   Mouse btn B
X   Umount in E-UAE GUI 
Y   E-UAE GUI



Usage:

	Launch retroarch , select a startup dsk , and e-uae sould boot.

	
Knows Bugs: 
 
	- the startup disk choose at start of retroarch is not mounted , use uae.cfg or gui to mount a disk.
	- When load savesate , exiting GUI without reset . You have to re-enter GUI and do the reset .
	- Everything not working well, It's a debug release , so expect to more bug.


We plan to use the core of winuae in the future, but no release date for now.
