E-UAE is based on the work of dozens of contributors including Bernd
Schmidt (the original author and maintainer of UAE), Bernie Meyer (the
author of the x86 JIT compiler), Toni Wilen (the current maintainer of
WinUAE), and many more.

This RETRO port is based on PS3 version E-UAE 0.8.29-WIP4 release 8
so aslo credits to Ole.

And of course for the RetroArch/Libretro team : "http://www.libretro.org/"

It's a quick hack.
At this time , works the basis but buggy on linux /android.

Remember ,Everything not working well, It's a debug release , so expect to more bug.

SEL Toggle Mouse/Joy mode .
STR Toggle Num Joy .

Knows Bugs:
