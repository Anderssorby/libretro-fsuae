README file for fs-uae-netplay-server


INSTALLING THE PACKAGE

Run python setup.py install to install the python package to your system.
It is also possible to execute the script fs_uae_netplay_server/game.py
for a single game server directly without installing.


RUNNING WITH PYTHON

Then you afterwards can start the netplay service with:
   python -m fs_uae_netplay_server.service

or a single game server with:
   python -m fs_uae_netplay_server.game


INSTALLED SCRIPTS

Scripts named fs-uae-netplay-server and fs-uae-netplay-game may also be
installed on your system, which can be used to start the service and/or
a single game server respectively (same as launching python with the modules
above).


THE SERVICE

The service listens on port 25000


RUNNING AS A LINUX SERVICE

If you install the debian packages, you will also get an init scripts which
starts fs-uae-netplay-server on startup, running as it's own user and storing
log files in /var/log/fs-uae-netplay-server. You must enable the service
in the file /etc/defaults/fs-uae-netplay-server first.
