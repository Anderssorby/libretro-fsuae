* Allocating 32-bit memory fails on some OS X / BSD setups. With 2.7.5dev+,
  32-bit memory is avoided when JIT is not enabled, but real fix is needed

* Opening the F12 menu / Using the modifier key causes FS-UAE to blink
  on Windows due to ungrabbing input (might have to disable this feature
  on Windows).

* When internal kickstart is being used and kickstart_file = internal
  was not used, show GUI message "Using AROS kickstart replacement".

* Portable x86-64 versions should be able to co-locate with x86-versions.
  (Fixed for Windows)

* Amiga key sticks when opening/closing FS-UAE menu with modifier+F12
