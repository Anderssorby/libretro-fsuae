* When starting FS-UAE from FS-UAE Launcher, accelerator flashs ROM writes
  are not persistent because the launcher uses a new copy every time.
* On OS X, cursor movement is currently not received by FS-UAE when the
  window is not focused (either something SDL 2 or OS X itself does). This
  makes mouse integration a bit less useful.
